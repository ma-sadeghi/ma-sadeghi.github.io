I am a researcher interested in optimizing energy systems. Currently, I focus on creating digital twins for battery systems using both physics-based and data-driven methods, which can be used in an optimization loop to improve battery performance. I am also interested in using ML to speed up solving partial differential equations on complex geometries and large domains that otherwise take too long to solve using physics-based solvers. A good example is computing the tortuosity or permeability factor from 3D images of porous materials, which could take days.
